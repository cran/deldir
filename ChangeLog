 Version 0.0-11 (09 December 2009)

 No change, really.  A tweak that I made to the First() function
 in version 0.0-10, *without* changing the version number (psigh!)
 did not propagate to the Windoze and Mac OSX binaries.

 So version 0.0-11 is just the same as the tweaked realization of
 of version 0.0-10 but with the version number changed so that the
 tweak will propagate.

                       *****************************

 Version 0.0-10 (16 November 2009)

 Got rid of the call to ind.dup() used a very rough
 bit of Fortran code to detect duplicated points, and
 replaced it with a call to duplicated().

 (Bug pointed out by Bjarke Christensen.)

                       *****************************

 Version 0.0-9 (4 November 2009)

 Added a new function tile.centroids() --- which does the obvious.
 Motivated by an inquiry from Leandro Moreira.

 Added a ChangeLog

                       *****************************

 Version 0.0-8 (4 April 2009)

 Removed the labels from the x and y vectors in the tile descriptions
 produced by tile.list.  These labels (which were the row numbers in
 the dirsgs data frame returned by deldir()) served no useful purpose
 and were potentially confusing.

                       *****************************

 Versions 0.0-2 through 0.0-7 were not tracked here. :-( Simply forgot
 about doing this.  I thouroughly *intend* [ :-) ] to get the archives
 from CRAN and try to document the changes.  Recent ones involved
 fixing bugs in and adding features to the tile.list() and
 plot.tile.list() functions.

                       *****************************

 Version 0.0-1 (21 February 2002)
 This version is simply an adaptation of the Splus version
 of the package to R.


=========================================================================================
The following items relate to the Splus versions of deldir
=========================================================================================

 Version date: 14 February 2002.
 This version supercedes the version dated 24 April 1999.

 The changes from the version dated 24 April 1999 to the
 version dated 14 February 2002 were:

	A bug in the procedure for eliminating duplicated points was
	fixed.  Thanks go to Dr. Berwin Turlach of the Department of
	Maths and Stats at the University of Western Australia, for
	spotting this bug.

                       *****************************

 Version date: 24 April 1999.
 This version supercedes the version dated 26 October 1998.

 The changes from the version dated 26 October 1998 to the
 version dated 24 April 1999 were:

	(1) The function mipd(), stored in mipd.sf, and the
	corresponding Fortran subroutine mipd, stored in mipd.r, have
	been replaced by mnnd() in mnnd.sf and mnnd in mnnd.r.  The
	function mipd calculated the mean interpoint distance, to be
	used in constructing dummy point structures of a certain
	type.  After some reflection it became apparent that the mean
	interpoint distance was much too large for the intended
	purpose, and that a more appropriate value was the ``mean
	nearest neighbour distance'' which is calculated by the new
	function.  This new value is now used in constructing dummy
	point structures.

	Note that the operative result is that the resulting dummy
	point structures contain many more points than before.  The
	old value caused large numbers of the dummy points to fall
	outside the data window and therefore to be clipped.

                       *****************************

 Version date: 26 October 1998.
 This version supercedes the version dated 6 December 1996.

 The changes from the version dated 6 December 1996 to the
 version dated 26 October 1998 were:

	(1) A ratfor/Fortran routine named ``inside'' has been
	renamed ``dldins'' to avoid conflict with a name built in to
	some versions of Splus.

	(2) Some minor corrections have been made to dangerous
	infelicities in a piece of the ratfor/Fortran code.

	(3) The dynamic loading procedure has been changed to use
	dyn.load.shared so that the package is easily usable on
	IRIX systems as well as under SunOS/Solaris.

	(4) The package has been adjusted slightly so that it
	can easily be installed as a section of a library.  In
	particular, the dynamic loading is now done by the
	.First.lib() function rather than from within deldir()
	itself; reference to an environment variable DYN_LOAD_LIB
	is no longer needed.
